# Play

Play is a full-stack JS / Express music-themed CRUD application and a partner project for Module 4 Back End students at Turing School of Software & Design. The project introduces students to Express with a Postgres database, Node.js, and HTTP testing in these frameworks.

[Visit Play in production on GitHub Pages!](https://beccahyland.github.io/play-frontend/)
 
Looking for our API back end? Visit [play-backend](https://github.com/clairebvs/play-backend).
 
Play interfaces with the external API [Musixmatch](https://developer.musixmatch.com/) to populate songs by a searched artist, then allows the user to track favorite songs and add favorites to playlists.
